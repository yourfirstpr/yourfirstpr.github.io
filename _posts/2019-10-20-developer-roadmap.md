One of my Firsts Pull Request has a topic related to a Roadmap for developers and computer scientiests! The repository is inspired by a know open source repository [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). The repository that I'm talking about is more related to some preferential and personal paths for becoming a professional in the computer science field. You can find the repository at the following [link](https://github.com/alinmigea/personal-roadmap), which is a fork of an old repository, or on the newer [link](https://github.com/CyberDani/Programming-puzzle-pieces)

Happy deciding while coding!
