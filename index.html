title: Showcasing good starter issues
---
  <section id='#introduction'>
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p id='headline'>
      Your First PR helps you get started contributing to Open Source by showcasing
      great starter issues on GitHub and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to make the open source community more accessible to new contributors, by
      helping project maintainers lower the barrier
      to entry through the use of well written issues and documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <h3>Contributors</h3>
    <p>
      Your First PR shares starter issues on our Twitter account at <a href='https://twitter.com/yourfirstpr'>@yourfirstpr</a>
      and on our <a href='https://github.com/yourfirstpr/yourfirstpr.github.io/issues'>GitHub's Issue Page</a>.
      Be sure to monitor these spaces to keep tabs on new issues that can be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Maintainers</h3>
    <p>
      Soon we will be writing guides on how to write good issues, use GitHub's issue template, and
      how to encourage people to contribute to your project. In the mean time,
      you can get started by reading the following texts on the subject:
