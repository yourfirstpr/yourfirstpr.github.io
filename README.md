## Configuring and running locally

This project uses Jekyll. First, clone this repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourfirstpr/yourfirstpr.github.io.git
cd yourfirstpr.github.io
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```
bundle
```

You can now run Jekyll using the following command:

You're now ready to go! Your local site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

If you want to use another port, you can provide the `-P` option like this:

bundle exec jekyll serve -P 4242
```
