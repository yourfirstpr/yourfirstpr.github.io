:orange_book: This is a guide to encourage project maintainers and inquiring minds to write better issues. :sparkles:

## Tips for Writing Issues
* **Be Objective -** Don't be vague. Give detailed descriptions and explanations. Don’t assume whoever is reading your issue can understand exactly what is wrong automatically. Read it over with the perspective of someone who knows nothing about it.
* **Be Clear and Concise -** While you want to give ample detail, nobody wants to read a doctoral thesis about it. Be short and to the point. Don’t stuff everything in the title either. The title should provide a clear general idea of the issue.
* **Formatting -** Take advantage of GitHub markdown. Use lists, bold or italicized text, and highlighting. Use URLs to link to your references, images to clarify information and @mentions for people whose attention is important. [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) is a guide for mastering markdown.
